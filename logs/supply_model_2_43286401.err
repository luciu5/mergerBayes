Loading required package: StanHeaders

rstan version 2.32.6 (Stan version 2.32.2)

For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
For within-chain threading using `reduce_sum()` or `map_rect()` Stan functions,
change `threads_per_chain` option:
rstan_options(threads_per_chain = 1)

Warning messages:
1: There were 18 divergent transitions after warmup. See

to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them. 
2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
 
3: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See

Warning messages:
1: 2 of the 11000 log_prob() evaluations on the proposal draws produced -Inf/Inf. 
2: Infinite value in iterative scheme, returning NA.
 Try rerunning with more samples.
